+ Project summary: The project estimated latent factors by gradient descent with probabilistic assumptions to create a basic rating matrix. In post-processing, we added KNN for each item as the second regression terms to improve the model, and combined the result of Kernel Ridge regression and the original mode, and then campared these two methods.
